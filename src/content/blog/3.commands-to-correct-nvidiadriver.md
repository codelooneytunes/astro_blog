## Headings
The error message

nvidia-smi
Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch
NVML library version: 550.90

## Paragraph
First, we should know which drivers are loaded.

lsmod | grep nvidia
You may get

nvidia_uvm            634880  8
nvidia_drm             53248  0
nvidia_modeset        790528  1 nvidia_drm
nvidia              12312576  86 nvidia_modeset,nvidia_uvm
Our final goal is to unload nvidia mod, so we should unload the module depend on nvidia:

sudo rmmod nvidia_drm
sudo rmmod nvidia_modeset
sudo rmmod nvidia_uvm
Then, unload nvidia

sudo rmmod nvidia
Troubleshooting
If you get an error like rmmod: ERROR: Module nvidia is in use, which indicates that the kernel module is in use, you should kill the process that using the kmod:

sudo lsof /dev/nvidia*
and then kill those process, then continue to unload the kmods.

Test
Confirm you successfully unload those kmods

lsmod | grep nvidia
You should get nothing. Then confirm you can load the correct driver:

nvidia-smi
You should get the correct output.
